;;; Commentary:

;; This package tries to re-implement some of nadvice.el's functionality
;; on top of the old defadvice system, to help users of defadvice
;; move to the new advice system without dropping support for Emacs<24.4.
;;
;; Limitations;
;; - only supports `advice-add', `advice-remove', and `advice-member-p'.
;; - only handles the :before, :after, :override, and :around kinds of advice;
;; - requires a named rather than anonymous function;
;; - and does not support any additional properties like `name' or `depth'.
;;
;; It was tested on Emacs-22 and I can't see any obvious reason why it
;; wouldn't work on older Emacsen.

;;; Code:

(declare-function ad-remove-advice "advice")

(eval-and-compile (require 'advice))

(unless (fboundp 'add-function)
  ;; If `add-function' is defined, we're presumably running on
  ;; an Emacs that comes with the real nadvice.el, so let's be careful
  ;; to do nothing in that case!

  ;; Load `advice' manually, in case `advice-remove' is called first,
  ;; since ad-remove-advice is not autoloaded.
  (require 'advice)

(defun advice-member-p (advice symbol)
  (ad-find-advice symbol 'around advice))

               ((eq where :before)
